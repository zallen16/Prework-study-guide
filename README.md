# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind designing this webpage was to learn in a hands-on way of what being a web developer is like. We covered the large and distinct bases of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, in an accessible and user-friendly way. This webpage states clearly what the distinctions are between these types of code, and is practical since these codes are so commonly introduced all at once together. I personally learned that desgigning a webpage does not need to be a strenuous activity; I also learned that constant communication among developers and servers is crucial for these types of projects.
